# Unicorn Companies Data Analysis and Streamlit Dashboard

This project includes an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of unicorn companies data and a Streamlit dashboard as part of the analysis.

## Overview

Unicorn companies are privately held startup companies valued at over $1 billion. This project explores data related to unicorn companies, including their valuations, funding, industries, and geographical locations. The EDA aims to provide insights into the unicorn landscape.
